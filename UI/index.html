            Probably a nice png graphic with transparent BG set as the bg.<br/>

            Clickable divs, or pngs, with nice onhover events.

            My Schedules. Let me show you them.<br/>
            <br/>
            I'll fire up photoshop at some point to make the graphics, the BG fade thing is from an old assignment from another class, I do want a repeat-y fade of some sort, but that warrants some playing around. Unless everyone thinks this is ok, then I'll leave it.<br/>
            <br/>
            Color Palatte is from my photoshop detective work on their movie-era NHL logo and jersey, contained as hex in the css file.<br/>
            If we want our own colors for branding that's fine too, we don't need to associate with our name (although it is convenient).<br/>
            <br/>
            For now, content can be dumped into this maincontent div, we can deal with other pages later as we start housecleaning a bit. I plan on only swapping the maincontent div out, it would be nice to have ajax requests with nice fades, but plain pagereloads would work as well.

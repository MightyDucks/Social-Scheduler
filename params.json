{"name":"Social-scheduler","body":"### Social Scheduler\r\n\r\nSocial Media and Facebook Integration has become commonplace in almost every web application. The ability to log in to websites through one set of credentials and have a persistent “friends list” allows for simpler user registration, more user connectivity, and a way to stay connected to friends and family. Determining what courses to take and what section to register for is an intensely social activity that currently involves being constantly in contact with friends whom you plan to take classes with. By creating a course registration application that includes facebook integration this entire process will become much more streamlined and simplified. This facilitates our goal of allowing all students the ability to quickly find and register for classes with their friends.\r\n\r\n### Check it out\r\n\r\nIf you would like to check out the code base you can either fork it on GitHub and create your own repository or you can clone ours with:\r\n\r\ngit clone git://github.com/MightyDucks/Social-Scheduler.git\r\n\r\n\r\n### Created By\r\n\r\nColin Steifel\r\nChrissy Ahier\r\nBen Vreeland\r\nGriffin Hammer","google":"","tagline":"RPI Social Scheduler","note":"Don't delete this file!
